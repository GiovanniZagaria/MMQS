<h1>UMLsec Authorized Status Smartcard Check</h1>
<h3>carisma.check.smartcard.authorizedstatus</h3>
<p>This check analyzes UML state diagrams using the &laquo;authorized-status&raquo; stereotype (cf. Ochoa et al. - Model-based Security Verification and Testing for Smartcards, 2011) by
checking every state marked by &laquo;authorized-status&raquo;. Incoming transitions to these states must have Constraints (Guards)
containing the permission string provided by the tag permission of the authorized state.</p>

<p>Annotate a model containing a state diagram with &laquo;authorized-status&raquo; as necessary and set the permission tag value. 
After finishing the model, <a href="../../../carisma.core/help/html/userguide/stepByStep.html">create a new CARiSMA analysis on the model</a>. Add the Smartcard Authorized Status Check to the used checks
and click "Run" to start the analysis.</p>
<p>The Analysis Results View displays whether the check was successful. If any incoming transition of an authorized state
doesn't contain the appropriate permission string in its guard, the violation is displayed in the Analysis Results View.</p>

<p>The example model contains an authorized state having an incoming transition with an incorrect guard.</p>

<img src="images/authorizedStatusRight.png" alt="authorized-status correct" name="authorized-status correct" />
<p>After correcting the model, the analysis reports the success of the check.</p>
