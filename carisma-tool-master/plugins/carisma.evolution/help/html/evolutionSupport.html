<h2>Evolution Support</h2>

<p>The components that provide the support for analyzing
evolution models are shown in Figure 1.</p>

<h5>Figure 1: The Evolution Architecture</h5>

<p>Evolutions to a model can be reflected by collections of
change descriptions. A change consists of one or more
exclusive alternative evolutions to a part of the model.
These alternatives can then be broken down to one or more delta
elements, which describe atomic changes to model elements.
More specific, we support the description of the addition,
deletion, substitution, editing and copying of model elements.
The content of an alternative will be applied in
a single evolutionary step.</p>

<p>Changes can be constrained using the three constraint
types AND, NOT and REQ. While AND forces another
change to be applied simultaneously, meaning during the
same evolutionary step of the model, NOT excludes the referenced
change from being applied to the model in the same
evolution. Finally, REQ ensures that the referenced change
is applied to the model before the constrained change takes
place. This is to ensure that dependent changes are applied
in the correct order.</p>

<p>CARiSMA provides an interface to generate change
descriptions (see Figure 2, Step 1). At the time of writing,
two implementations of this interface are incorporated into
CARiSMA: the UMLchangeParser, which creates the change
descriptions from UMLchange applications on the model,
and the EMFDelta, which generates the change descriptions
by computing the difference between the original and the
evolved model using EMF Compare.</p>

<p>A delta is a set of the above mentioned delta elements.
The elements in the set are the atomic changes that amount
to a possible evolution to the model. The delta factory (Step
2) receives a collection of change descriptions and processes
the change constraints and alternatives, thereby generating
all possible permutations over the alternatives, including the
empty set, while following the constraints imposed by the
changes. The elements of each valid change permutation
are stored as a delta.</p>

<p>A delta can be applied to the model using implementations
of the IModifier interface (Step 3b).
An existing implementation is the UMLModifier. The UMLModifier receives
the original model, creates a copy of it and applies each
atomic change described by a delta element to the model
copy. The resulting model is stored for use in CARiSMA
evolution-aware checks (Step 3a). To avoid unnecessary
computation of model modifications, the models are lazily
initialized only when a check needs the modified model for
validation. Modifications are mainly executed via generic
EMF methods, while the selection of UML-specific aspects
are handled using a custom logic. It would therefore be easy
to build other model-specific modifier implementations.</p>

<p>The existing CARiSMA evolution checks each receive the
list of computed deltas and iterate over each while checking
the validity of the delta's modifications. If any change
leads to the model not respecting the checked security property,
the corresponding delta is removed from the list to
prevent subsequent checks from unnecessarily checking this
delta again.</p>

<p>The evolved models which passed all checks can then be
persistently stored using the ModelExporter (Step 4). Their
corresponding deltas can also be stored in an XML format
alongside the models.</p>
