<h2>The UMLchange Notation</h2>
<p>	In the first two years of the SecureChange project, UMLseCh has been developed as a notation
for describing multiple possible evolution paths of a model. It was further shown
how UMLseCh can be used to improve security analysis for evolving models, because of the fact that the models
do not have to be re-verified completely but the verification can be limited to the changes.</p>

<p>UMLseCh was an extension of the well-known UMLsec profile. Hence, it was tightly
bound to security engineering and security analysis. We have now extracted the evolution
specific parts of UMLseCh and elaborated them into the UMLchange profile. The profile
is thus no longer bound to security properties. Although UMLchange is still used in a
security context and together with UMLsec, we decided for the separation of concerns.
Security aspects and evolution aspects are now separated in two different profiles. However,
the merger of both profiles will result in UMLseCh which was already presented,
which can be expressed with the formula:</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px"><i>UMLseCh = UMLsec + UMLchange</i></p>

<p>Nonetheless, there have been various improvement in the stereotypes for describing evolution.
This document introduces the new UMLchange profile and shows 
how it can be used to describe different evolutions. In particular, we will explain the grammar
which is used to describe additive changes.</p>
