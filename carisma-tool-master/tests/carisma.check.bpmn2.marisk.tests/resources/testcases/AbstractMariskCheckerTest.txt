Class: AbstractMariskChecker

Method: checkDutySeperation
	1. activity1 and activity2 are performed by the same actor (or rather in the same lane atm)
		Result: returns false
	2. activity1 and activity2 are not performed by the same actor (or rather in the same lane atm)
		Result: returns true
	3. activity1 and/or activity2 have no actor
		Result: returns true

Method: hasTrace
	1. allTraces contains activities in order with specified startevent
		Result: returns true
	2. allTraces contains activities in order but not the specified startevent
		Result: returns false
	3. allTraces contains activities in order, startevent = null
		Result: returns true
	4. allTraces contains activities in wrong order, startevent = null
		Result: returns false

Method: hasBoundaryEventOfType
	1. activity has no boundaryevent of the specified type
		Result: returns false
	2. activity has boundaryEvent of the specified type but cancelActivity does not align
		Result: returns false 
	3. activity has boundaryEvent of the specified type and cancelActivity does align
		Result: returns true
	4. activity has boundaryEvent of the specified type and cancelActivity equals null
		Result: returns true

Method: setAllTraces
	1. Model has only one path
		Result: one path in allTraces
	2. Model has Gateways with multiple outgoing sequence flows
		Result: one path in allTraces for each reachable leaf 
	3. Model has three-link loop
		Result: one additional path in allTraces where the loop is traversed once
	4. Model has two loops with the same starting and ending activities with no other parameter-activites on the loop 
		Result: one path for both loops in allTraces
	5. Model contains these Links A->B->C->D, C->A, D->B
