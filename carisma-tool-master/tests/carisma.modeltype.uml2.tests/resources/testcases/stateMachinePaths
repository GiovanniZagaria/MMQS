This plugin determines all possible paths through a state machine.
Beginning from the InitialNodes, it determines all possible Paths from the 
InitialNode to the end, what could be a FinalNode, a Node with no Outgoing Transition 
or a kind of Loop.

As input it needs a StateMachine, an AnalysisHost (can be null) and a boolean if 
Transitions should also occur in the result or not.
As output, you get all the possible paths through the given StateMachine.

This plugin is also able to get all StateMachines out of a Model.

1. The given Model is null --> NullpointerException | testNull()
2. There are no paths in the StateMachine --> result is an empty List | testNoPath()
3. Otherwise you get all the as List<List<Element>> as result. where every inner List 
represents one path.
