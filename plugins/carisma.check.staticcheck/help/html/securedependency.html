<h2>UMLsec Static Secure Dependency Check</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This check analyzes UML static structure diagrams marked with the
UMLsec stereotype &laquo;secure dependency&raquo; (cf. "Secure Systems Development with UML", p. 59 ff.).
For each &laquo;usage dependency&raquo; marked with &laquo;call&raquo; or &laquo;send&raquo;, the check analyzes if the involved classes and interfaces fulfill the rules of the &laquo;secure dependency&raquo; property.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Annotate a package containing a class/interface structure with the &laquo;secure dependency&raquo; stereotype.
Add the desired &laquo;critical&raquo; stereotypes and mark the appropriate methods in the tags.
After this steps are done, <a href="../../../carisma.core/help/html/userguide/stepByStep.html">create a new CARiSMA analysis on the model</a>.
Add the <i>Static Secure Dependency Check</i> to the used checks and click "Run" to start the analysis.</p>

<p>The Analysis Results View displays whether the check was successful. If any &laquo;critical&raquo; section is not defined in all involved classes and interfaces,
information about the location and type of that violation are also displayed in the Analysis Results View.</p>

<h4>Example1: SecureDependency is violated</h4>
<img src="images/secureDependencyWrong.png" alt="secure dependency violation" name="secure dependency violation" />
<p>The example model is consciously designed to contain a &laquo;secure dependency&raquo; violation, which is described in the
Analysis Results View.</p>

<h4>Example2: SecureDependency is fulfilled</h4>
<img src="images/secureDependencyRight.png" alt="secure dependency corrected" name="secure dependency corrected" />
<p>After correcting the model, the analysis reports the success of the check.</p>
