<p>CARiSMA is not a single tool but a set of Eclipse plugins. The basis of the CARiSMA tool is Eclipse and its EMF framework. 
The core tool is contained in the plugin <i>carisma.core</i>. It provides the GUI components, loading mechanism, a check registry, and general utility classes.</p>

<p>The core tool is extended by a model type specific component, which is <i>carisma.modeltype.uml2</i> in case of UML2.
This component provides the definition of the meta model, a concrete loader, and convenience methods and utility functions for working with models of this type.
The model type components present in CARiSMA use standard component providing the meta model. In the case of UML2 the plugin uses the UML2 Plugin for Eclipse.
Using the model type plugin and the core plugin, plugins for model analysis can be developed, e.g. the <i>carisma.check.staticcheck</i> plugin.</p> 

<p>The analysis plugins for UML models may depend on UML profiles which are provided by profile plugins such as <i>carisma.profile.umlsec</i>.
This plugin, for instance, contains the UMLsec profile which is used by most UMLsec analysis plugins (i.e. those migrated from the old UMLsec tool).
The figure describes the architecture for UML2 models.</p>
